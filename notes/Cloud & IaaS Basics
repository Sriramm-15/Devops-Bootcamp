# DigitalOcean (Beginner Notes)

## What is DigitalOcean?
- **DigitalOcean** is a cloud provider.
- It offers **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**.
- With it, you can create:
  - Virtual Machines (called **Droplets**)
  - Databases
  - Load Balancers
  - Networking resources, etc.

---

## Droplets (Virtual Machines)
- A **Droplet** = DigitalOcean’s virtual machine.
- You can choose:
  - **Image** (e.g., Ubuntu, Docker pre-installed, etc.)
  - **Size** (CPU, RAM, storage)
  - **SSH Key** (for secure login without passwords)

---

## Why is it useful?
- Very easy setup: just pick an image + size → VM ready.
- Can run Docker containers inside Droplets.
- Great for developers who want to quickly test & deploy apps.

---

## Networking with DigitalOcean
- You can **network multiple Droplets** together.
- You can **open ports** to the internet for external access.
- Common uses:
  - Expose a service like **Nexus** running directly on a VM.
  - Expose a service like a **Docker container** (e.g., Jenkins) running inside a Droplet.
